## TITLE:
**MyMeta v1.0.0 - Free media file metadata manager (Windows)**

---

## POST:

```markdown
I made a free tool for organizing media files and thought some of you might find it useful.

**What it does:**
Automatically fetches metadata from TMDB, OMDb, or AniDB and embeds it directly into your MP4/MKV files with cover art.

**Main features:**
• One-click tool setup (FFmpeg, MKVToolNix, AtomicParsley)
• Batch processing
• Customizable file naming templates  
• 8 accent color themes
• Portable - no installation needed

**Example:**
```
random_movie.mp4  →  Inception (2010).mp4
```
With embedded title, description, genres, cast, rating, and cover art.

**Download:** [GitHub Release Link]  
**License:** MIT (completely free)

The software is provided as-is. I hope some of you find it helpful!

Feel free to ask questions or report any issues on GitHub.
